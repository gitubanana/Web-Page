            <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>.<br>
            As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.<br>
            All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>
            <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
            It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br>
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
